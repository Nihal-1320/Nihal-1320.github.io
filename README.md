| 16 July 2024 | Prof. Nisha Masson | Prof. Nisha Masson took a quiz in our class. The quiz contained vocabulary questions, Naming personalities, jumble words and many others things. This quiz was quite fun and I learnt alot about new vocabulary words and personalities.

He gave us some questions to solve which we did and also some questions as our assignment to solve at home. He taught us by giving some easy examples which made the understanding even easier. His class was quite interesting and I grasped most of it. That was all about Mr. Sukhminder Singh. 
| Same day | Prof. Nisha Masson | Prof. Nisha Masson taught  us about Human Values. There was a lot to understand from this class for me. It was an interesting class but To be honest I couldn't understand most of it because I couldn't understand most of the words properly. But some things were definitely clear to me and Ma'am taught us about introduction to Human values and also about harmony in human beings. Ma'am taught that there are two aspirations in one's life. These are Happiness and prosperity. We were also taught about Right Understanding, Fulfillment in relationships, physicsl facility and a lot other things. I would certainly go to ma'am to ask more about this subject. Also a proficiency test was conducted in the english lab of english subject which included some do as directed, some sentence formation and also other stuff 
| 18 July 2024 | Prof. Nisha Masson | Prof. Nisha Masson is our UHV teacher. So this class was also regarding Human values. Previously ma'am taight us about Harmony in oneself and introduction to values but this time they taught us about harmony in relationships and how to maintain relationships properly. Also that relationships should be wisely made and if you won't properly play your role, there is no one to save this relationship. Ma'am also taught us about the 9 feelings in a relationship which included Respect, Care, Affection, Reverence, Guidance, Trust, Gratitude, Jealousy and finally Love. All these together construct a relationship with which one can live in a healthy relationship. 
| Same Day | Peer Interaction College | In this class, we were given information about the college's website, a bit information about the canteens and stationary shop in the college and some more information about the college. Knowing about the college was a great experience and fun. 
| Same Day | NCC and NSS | This last lecture was informative about the National Cadet Corporation(NCC) and National Student Service(NSS). We were given information about various facilities provided by these services and also various activities performed by them. We were also shown a lot of achievements achieved by these two. Interested students were asked to join and this was all. 
| 19 July 2024 | Er. Kanwardeep Kalra | Er. Kanwardeep Kalra was a great speaker. She taught us about the skills focusing mainly on soft skills. In easy words, soft skills means behaviour and the way to talk. Ma'am taught that having only hard skills(the skills which are used to earn money) are not only important. But rather a person's behaviour is more important. She gave us an example by showing a play. Her main topic was only soft skills and the importance of behaviour, dressing sense, and confidence level in an interview. She said that skill and knowledge does matter but soft skills are more important. She also said that most of the students are hired who are better at communication rather than only skill. That's all about her. 
| Same Day | Prof. Jaswinder Singh | Prof. Jaswinder Singh was definitely an amazing person. To be honest, it was the most fun and enjoying class as far. He was a science teacher and he not only taught science but also showed us some experiments regarding that. There was a student who was volunteered by him and with his help, he was able to show us a lot of interesting and fun experiment like rain alarm and proved that human body is a conductor. He also showed an experment about the phenomenon of light, 'refraction'. He showed that a convex lens produces a real and inverted image by seeing a person through the lens. He also showed that speed of sound is different in air and water which he showed through a small bird whistle. He also showed the concept of surface tension by using sieve and water. It was definitely the most interesting class by far in induction programme and was definitely worth watching. 
| Same Day | Department Visit | We also visited the Computer Science and Engineering department where we were given us the information about the clubs associated with the CSE department and also a bit about the curriculum. We were motivated that everything would go right and if we did the right amount of hardwork, we would definitely be successful. Also, the mark distribution of both the semesters. This was all in this visit.
