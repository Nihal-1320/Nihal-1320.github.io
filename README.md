| 15 July 2024 | Dr. Pyare Lal  | Today, Dr. Pyare Lal taught us abt this world by sharing his own experiences. His main teachings included about never giving up in life and always working hard. He taught that it is stupid to give up before even trying anything,assured that if people work hard and never gave up, sucess is just right next to them. He also shared some knowledge about the Universe. He says that the universe,even though being so big is just  positive and negative energy. He taught that a person should never have any ego in him. He should always be kind and respectful. He says that people should not live in dreams and wake up to reality and work for there dreams to fulfill in real life. He teaught us to never lose hope because according to him if a person lost hope, he loses everything. He also taught to be the man of ur words and keep your promises. Not only he taught to be successful but also to be a good human being who does good deeds. He says there is no limit for knowledge for a person. The more knowledge he takes, the more better he becomes. This is all what I remember from the things taught by Dr. Pyare Lal |
