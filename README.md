With a vision to combat economic backwardness through technological advancement, the institution was initially founded as a Polytechnic in 1953.

| Same Day | **Er. Jiwandeep Singh** | Er. Jiwandeep Singh taught us to seek out opportunities and seize them. Be proactive in pursuing experiences that align with your goals and interests. Don't wait for opportunities to come to you - create your own. Take calculated risks, step out of your comfort zone, and embrace challenges that help you grow. Whether it's internships, networking events, or volunteer work, seize every chance to learn and build valuable connections. Engage with long-form content to deepen your knowledge. In today's fast-paced digital age, it's easy to get caught up in bite-sized information. However, to truly deepen your understanding of a subject, engage with long-form content like books, research papers, and in-depth articles. This will help you develop critical thinking skills, gain nuanced insights, and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in your field. Identify your passion as soon as possible. Discovering your passion can be a game-changer. It can transform your studies, career, and overall life trajectory. Explore various interests, reflect on what drives you, and experiment with different activities. The earlier you identify your passion, the sooner you can align your efforts, make meaningful progress, and unlock a sense of purpose and fulfillment.
