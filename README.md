| Same day | **Prof. Nisha Masson** | Prof. Nisha Masson taught  us about Human Values. There was a lot to understand from this class for me. It was an interesting class but To be honest I couldn't understand most of it because I couldn't understand most of the words properly. But some things were definitely clear to me and Ma'am taught us about introduction to Human values and also about harmony in human beings. Ma'am taught that there are two aspirations in one's life. These are Happiness and prosperity. We were also taught about Right Understanding, Fulfillment in relationships, physicsl facility and a lot other things. I would certainly go to ma'am to ask more about this subject. Also a proficiency test was conducted in the english lab of english subject which included some do as directed, some sentence formation and also other stuff

Ma'am also taught us about the 9 feelings in a relationship which included Respect, Care, Affection, Reverence, Guidance, Trust, Gratitude, Jealousy and finally Love. All these together construct a relationship with which one can live in a healthy relationship.

| 19 July 2024 | **Er. Kanwardeep Kalra** | Er. Kanwardeep Kalra was a great speaker. She taught us about the skills focusing mainly on soft skills. In easy words, soft skills means behaviour and the way to talk. Ma'am taught that having only hard skills(the skills which are used to earn money) are not only important. But rather a person's behaviour is more important. She gave us an example by showing a play. Her main topic was only soft skills and the importance of behaviour, dressing sense, and confidence level in an interview. She said that skill and knowledge does matter but soft skills are more important. She also said that most of the students are hired who are better at communication rather than only skill. That's all about her. 
| Same Day | **Prof. Jaswinder Singh** | Prof. Jaswinder Singh was definitely an amazing person. To be honest, it was the most fun and enjoying class as far. He was a science teacher and he not only taught science but also showed us some experiments regarding that.

He also showed an experment about the phenomenon of light, 'refraction'. He showed that a convex lens produces a real and inverted image by seeing a person through the lens. He also showed that speed of sound is different in air and water which he showed through a small bird whistle. He also showed the concept of surface tension by using sieve and water. It was definitely the most interesting class by far in induction programme and was definitely worth watching.

This was all in this visit. 
| 22 July 2024 | **Dr. S.B Singh** | Dr. S.B Singh taught us a lot by sharing his life experiences with us and his main goal was that students should know themselves properly. So for that, he gave us a series of questions which we had to write down on a paper.

He also taught us about the the surface learning which means just studying not deeply. He told that is a person wants to he successful in life, he had to study deeply and clear every concept. This is the only way to study. He also wanted us to know our learning style, if it is auditory, or making notes or any other way.
